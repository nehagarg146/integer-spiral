This seed is designed as a starting point for writing AngularJS applications. 

Put all source code in the `/app` folder.
Modify the `package.json` to include information about your app and
run `npm install` to install all node libraries listed.

## install

`npm install`

## unit test:

`npm test`

## source linting

`npm run eslint`

## serve the application

`npm start`

## function/ui test

you will need to run the following commands in 3 different terminals

1. `npm start`
2. `npm run start-webdriver`
3. `npm run protractor`

When you are done testing you will need to shutdown the server and webdriver proxy by sending a control-C code to each terminal.
